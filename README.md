Java is strongly typed, which means the value we store in a variable must be appropriate to its data type
We cannot store objects in a variable
Arrays are objects regardless of whether they are declared to hold primitive values or object references
A class is a blueprint for an object
ArrayList is an adjustable array that has methods of adding, removing, setting, and checking indices and elements of its list
Plan programs with their future in mind
Inheritance hierarchies are usually wide and not deep
We can make a class abstract to prevent objects from being created from them
We can still use an abstract class for referencing the subclasses
